# MNIST Dataset for Handwritten Digit Recognition
The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset for machine learning and computer vision research. It contains 60,000 labeled training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9). The images are 28x28 grayscale pixels, and each pixel is represented by an integer value from 0 to 255. The goal of using the MNIST dataset is to train machine learning models to recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you on how to use the MNIST dataset for your machine learning project.

## Prerequisites
You will need to have the following packages installed in order to use the MNIST dataset:

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installing
MNIST Dataset is uploaded to this repository as zip file. It contains two csv files - one with train data and the other with test data

## Usage
You can use the MNIST dataset to train a variety of machine learning models, such as neural networks, decision trees, and random forests. You can also use the dataset to perform image classification tasks and evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms.
